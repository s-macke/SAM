 outTime is the time in samples when the buffer(s) processed by
 this callback will begin being played at the audio output.
 See also Pa_StreamTime()

 intended for storing synthesis data etc.
 
 return value:
 The callback can return a non-zero value to stop the stream. This may be
 useful in applications such as soundfile players where a specific duration
 of output is required. However, it is not necessary to utilise this mechanism
 as StopStream() will also terminate the stream. A callback returning a
 non-zero value must fill the entire outputBuffer.

/*
 Pa_OpenStream() opens a stream for either input, output or both.
 
 stream is the address of a PortAudioStream pointer which will receive
 a pointer to the newly opened stream.
 
 inputDevice is the id of the device used for input (see PaDeviceID above.)
 inputDevice may be paNoDevice to indicate that an input device is not required.
 
 numInputChannels is the number of channels of sound to be delivered to the
 callback. It can range from 1 to the value of maxInputChannels in the
 PaDeviceInfo record for the device specified by the inputDevice parameter.
 If inputDevice is paNoDevice numInputChannels is ignored.
 
 inputSampleFormat is the sample format of inputBuffer provided to the callback
 function. inputSampleFormat may be any of the formats described by the
 PaSampleFormat enumeration (see above). PortAudio guarantees support for
 the device's native formats (nativeSampleFormats in the device info record)
 and additionally 16 and 32 bit integer and 32 bit floating point formats.
 Support for other formats is implementation defined.
 
 inputDriverInfo is a pointer to an optional driver specific data structure
 containing additional information for device setup or stream processing.
 inputDriverInfo is never required for correct operation. If not used
 inputDriverInfo should be NULL.
 
 outputDevice is the id of the device used for output (see PaDeviceID above.)
 outputDevice may be paNoDevice to indicate that an output device is not required.
 
 numOutputChannels is the number of channels of sound to be supplied by the
 callback. See the definition of numInputChannels above for more details.
 
 outputSampleFormat is the sample format of the outputBuffer filled by the
 callback function. See the definition of inputSampleFormat above for more
 details.
 
 outputDriverInfo is a pointer to an optional driver specific data structure
 containing additional information for device setup or stream processing.
 outputDriverInfo is never required for correct operation. If not used
 outputDriverInfo should be NULL.
 
 sampleRate is the desired sampleRate. For full-duplex streams it is the
 sample rate for both input and output
 
 framesPerBuffer is the length in sample frames of all internal sample buffers
 used for communication with platform specific audio routines. Wherever
 possible this corresponds to the framesPerBuffer parameter passed to the
 callback function.
 
 numberOfBuffers is the number of buffers used for multibuffered communication
 with the platform specific audio routines. If you pass zero, then an optimum
 value will be chosen for you internally. This parameter is provided only
 as a guide - and does not imply that an implementation must use multibuffered
 i/o when reliable double buffering is available (such as SndPlayDoubleBuffer()
 on the Macintosh.)
 
 streamFlags may contain a combination of flags ORed together.
 These flags modify the behaviour of the streaming process. Some flags may only
 be relevant to certain buffer formats.
 
 callback is a pointer to a client supplied function that is responsible
 for processing and filling input and output buffers (see above for details.)
 
 userData is a client supplied pointer which is passed to the callback
 function. It could for example, contain a pointer to instance data necessary
 for processing the audio buffers.
 
 return value:
 Upon success Pa_OpenStream() returns PaNoError and places a pointer to a
 valid PortAudioStream in the stream argument. The stream is inactive (stopped).
 If a call to Pa_OpenStream() fails a non-zero error code is returned (see
 PaError above) and the value of stream is invalid.
